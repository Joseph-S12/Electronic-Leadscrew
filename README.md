# Electronic-Leadscrew

## Hardware requirements
This project is designed to run on an RP2040 board such as the Pico.
It may be modified to work on other microcontroller, but it would mean reworking it to not rely on the Pico SDK.

It also needs a quadrature encoder with at least 100 steps, in order to operate well.

It is designed to use the TM1638 to drive 8 7-segment displays (with decimal points), along with 8 LEDs for the status.

Schematics will be published once the project is in a practically usable state.
